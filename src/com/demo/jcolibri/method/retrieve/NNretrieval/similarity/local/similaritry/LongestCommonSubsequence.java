/**
 * The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem consists in finding the longest
 * subsequence common to two (or more) sequences. It differs from problems of
 * finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required
 * to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
 *
 * It is used by the diff utility, by Git for reconciling multiple changes, etc.
 *
 * The LCS distance between Strings X (length n) and Y (length m) is n + m - 2
 * |LCS(X, Y)| min = 0 max = n + m
 *
 * LCS distance is equivalent to Levenshtein distance, when only insertion and
 * deletion is allowed (no substitution), or when the cost of the substitution
 * is the double of the cost of an insertion or deletion.
 *
 * ! This class currently implements the dynamic programming approach, which has
 * a space requirement O(m * n)!
